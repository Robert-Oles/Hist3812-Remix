# Process Notes #

## February 23rd 2018 ##

Started by examining various resources for what I wanted to mash-up for this modules remix. After some some trials of mashing up Louise McKinney and some undeniably evil things I thought that those models failed to capture the concept that Iw as wanting to protray so I restarted with the Mercedes Model.

Step One

After downloading the required models and installing MeshMaker, open the software and import the first Mercedes Model, then Import the Louise Model by selecting Import > Append which should result in both models being open within the object viewer. 

Step Two

Open the actions tab and select Units and insure that the settings in this tab match the one found in the [picture](https://gyazo.com/0d189ae8e04e856adaf6a3d4aeccb42c)

Step Three

Using the transform tool, scale both models to the desired scale and move them into position
*This is an unpleasant reminder to make sure you record all these values as I go to type this out I relize I never marked down the exact scale changes to the two models*
Step Four

Using the plane cut tool, remove various "excess" pieces from the Louise McKinney model aiming to keep only the head in-tact

Step Five

Using the transform tool, complete any last adjustments to the model to ensure you get the desired effect before selecting both objects in the object viewer and combining them.*

Step Six

Export as a .obj file and upload it to Sketchfab
