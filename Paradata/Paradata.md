**Why has the resource being created and for what audience?**

This object was created as an example of how a person with relatively average software skills can use programs to combine models to remix them into something entirely new but still truthful. 

**How will the resource be put to use? Is it sustainable and accessible?**

This resource will be used to serve as a record of this process and hopefully as a way to highlight on the form of an artifact impacts the way that an individual views it. 
As for the accessibility and sustainability of this artifact, it is currently stored for download on Sketchfab  which will remain accessible so long as the site does, coupled with the fact that I have local copies saved to my harddrive. 
The main concern with sustainability isn't necessarily with the artifact itself but rather with the process. Meshmixer, the program used to combine the two objects is a free software currently but it is owned by Autodesk which is known for placing its products behind paywalls. 

**Why have you chosen to use the approach/methods applied?**

When I set out to create this remix I wanted a way to change the way that we view the object that I was originally working with, and knowing the controversial background of the [Famous Five](https://github.com/Robert-Oles/Hist3812-Remix/tree/master/object-biography) I wanted to highlight and showcase the contrast. 
I specifically chose to do a mash-up of two artifacts when I revisited the core concepts of the course to help me decide what I wanted to do. After re-reading *The migration of the aura or how to explore the original through its face similes* by Bruno Latour & Adam Lowe. 
In the chapter, the authors discuss the impacts on the way that a painting is interpreted based on the room its in and how the surrounding of an object are also a part of our interpretation of it (Latour, 2011 p. 108). This set my mind on highlighting the darker past of both Louise McKinney and Mercedes-Benz by mashing the two objects together.
As for the actual process, the artifact was created using a tutorial provided by James Novak in created in 2017 that is available (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH8Aohzpbgk]

** What are the basic steps you followed in putting together the resource?**

*Step One*

Downloaded the Mercedes Model off of Sketchfab and imported it and my Louise McKinney model into Autodesk Meshmixer

*Step Two*

Altered the units and grid size to better fit the model and allow for more precise transformations

*Step Three*

Using the transform tool, scaled both models to the desired scale and moved them into position

*Step Four*

Using the plane cut tool, I removed various "excess" pieces from the Louise McKinney model aiming to keep only the head in-tact

**Side Note: If you are looking to get into my headspace on what I was aiming for while making this model just think Thomas the Tank Engine meets Luxury Sports Car and Feminist Icon**

*Step Five*

Using the transform tool, complete any last adjustments to the model to ensure you get the desired effect before selecting both objects in the object viewer and combining them.*

*Step Six*

Export as a .obj file and upload it to Sketchfab

*How have you acknowledged uncertainty in the resource? Where might alternative interpretations have been made or where are such interpretations otherwise available for viewing audiences to refer to?**

It is important to recognize that much of the uncertainty that can be found in this resource is based on the actual construction of the comprising models themselves. I have personally addressed the uncertainty of the Louise McKinney model in a post located (here)[https://github.com/Robert-Oles/hist3812-Photogrammetry-/blob/master/paradata/paradata.md] That reads: What's interesting about working with a statue such as this is that my model is now an interpretation of Barbara Paterson's sculpture which was created from reference images in 1999 (Barbara Paterson, 2004). So realistically this model is not a direct model of Louise McKinny but rather a model of an artists interpretation of them. Furthermore, contextual elements such as snow or lighting may also impact the reliability of the resource. It is important to recognize that the statue on parliament hill is not the only one and that another can be found at St. Albert City Hall and the Ghosts Project in Red Deer both of which are in Alberta. (Barbara Paterson, 2004)

As for the Mercedes Model, the intention of this work was not to necessarily use the most accurate render of a Mercedes car but rather to use a model as a tool of changing the way we observe the brand when compared to the complex legacy of the company. Therefore, it is not necessarily as critical that the model is 100% accurate but if you are looking for other well rendered models of Mercedes cars, Sketchfab contains a variety of objects that are highly detailed but not re-distributable.
