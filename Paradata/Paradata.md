**Why has the resource being created and for what audience?**

This object was created as an example of how a person with realitivly average software skills can use programs to combine models to remix them into something entirely new but still truthful. 

**How will the resource be put to use? Is it sustainable and accessible?**

This resource will be used to serve as a record of this process and hopefully as a way to highlight on the form of an artifact impacts the way that an indivudal views it. 
As for the accessiability and sustainability of this artifact, it is currently stored for download on Sketchfab  which will remain accessable so long as the site does, coupled with the fact that I have local copies saved to my harddrive. 
The main concern with sustainability isnt necessarily with the artifact itself but rather with the process. Meshmixer, the program used to combine the two objects is a free software currently but it is owned by Autodesk which is known for placing its products behind paywalls. 

**Why have you chosen to use the approach/methods applied?**

When I set out to create this remix I wanted a way to change the way that we view the object that I was originally working with, and knowing the controversial background of the [Famous Five](https://github.com/Robert-Oles/Hist3812-Remix/tree/master/object-biography) I wanted to highlight and showcase the contrast. 
I specifcally chose to do a mash-up of two artifacts when I revisted the core concepts of the course to help me decide what I wanted to do. After re-reading *The migration of the aura or how to explore the original through its fac similes* by Bruno Latour & Adam Lowe. 
In the chapter, the authors discuss the impacts on the way that a painting is intrepreted based on the room its in and how the surrondings of an object are also a part of our intrepration of it (Latour, 2011 p. 108). This set my mind on highlighting the darker past of both Louise McKinney and Mercedes-Benz by mashing the two objects together.
As for the actual process, the artifact was created using a tutorial provided by James Novak in created in 2017 that is available (here)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bH8Aohzpbgk]

** What are the basic steps you followed in putting together the resource?**

*Step One*

Downloaded the Mercedes Model off of Sketchfab and imported it and my Louise McKinney model into Autodesk Meshmixer

*Step Two*

Altered the units and grid size to better fit the model and allow for more procise transformations

*Step Three*

Using the transform tool, scaled both models to the desired scale and moved them into position

*Step Four*

Using the plane cut tool, I removed various "excess" pieces from the Louise McKinney model aiming to keep only the head in-tact

**Side Note: If you are looking to get into my headspace on what I was aiming for while making this model just think Thomas the Tank Engine meets Luxary Sports Car and Feminist Icon**

*Step Five*

Using the transform tool, complete any last adjustments to the model to ensure you get the desired effect before selecting both objects in the object viewer and combining them.*

*Step Six*

Export as a .obj file and upload it to Sketchfab
